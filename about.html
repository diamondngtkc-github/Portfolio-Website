          <p>Thank you for visiting my virtual home out of a billion websites on the net!</p>
          <p>I'm Diamond Nguyen, a dedicated multimedia artist and educator. After spending more than a decade abroad studying and working, I've recently returned to my home in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, with a background in 2D/3D animation and a fervor for the intertwining of Art, Design, and Technology.</p>
          <p>My educational journey began at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, where I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Animation. From there, I ventured to the Burgundy School of Business in France to obtain a Master's degree in Arts and Cultural Management. My Master's thesis focused on "The Performance of Online/Virtual Museums during the COVID-19 Pandemic," igniting a passion for exploring the potential of virtual spaces in art education.</p>
          <p>Today, as an Associate Lecturer in the Digital Media Program at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Saigon South Campus (RMIT Vietnam) and as the Lead Visual Designer & 3D Artist at Oxolo, I have the privilege of both applying and sharing my knowledge. I am continuously intrigued by how we can fuse Technology, Art, and Design to foster better learning experiences and promote public engagement.</p>
          <p>Over the years, I have contributed to various animation projects as a freelance animator, and to the visual design of installations in Singapore, which has been a rewarding experience. Now, my next goal is to delve deeper into these realms by embarking on a rigorous PhD research project, allowing me to pioneer new pathways in our understanding of digital arts and education.</p>
          <p>Guided by a deep interest in my field and a commitment to advancing the fusion of Technology, Art, and Design in education, I'm excited about the possibilities the future holds. If you're a fellow artist, an educator, a potential collaborator, or a curious visitor, I invite you to connect with me. You can reach me via email at diamondngtkc[at]gmail[dot]com. I look forward to exploring how we can pioneer change and ignite innovation in the world of digital arts together.</p>
