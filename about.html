		<p>Thank you for visiting my virtual home out of 1.8 billion websites out there! It is my pleasure to welcome you to my collection of work. You can call me Diamond.</p>
		<p>I am finishing my <b>masterâ€™s degree in Arts and Cultural Management</b> at the Burgundy School of Business in Dijon, France. I also have a <b>bachelor's degree in Digital Animation</b> from the School of Art, Design, and Media, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.</p>
		<p>Before I departed for France, from October 2015 to August 2019, I worked as a <b>Visual Artist and User Experience Specialist</b> at IcebergX studio in Singapore. My expertise covered brainstorming, designing, and innovating effective creative projects from concept through completion for a myriad of well-established brands and clients. We leveraged <b>humans, data, and technologies</b> to be the branding and advertising expert. Our clients included many popular names who looked for innovative, interactive, and immersive solutions to attract huge audiences in Singapore and neighboring Asian countries such as <b>OUE</b> (Real Estate Owner and Developer), <b>Singapore National Library Board</b> - NLB,<b> Gardens by the Bay</b>, <b>Changi Airport</b>, <b>Singapore Housing Development Board</b> - HDB Gallery, etc.</p>
		<p>Besides the interest in arts and technology, exploring different cultures and meeting people from diverse backgrounds have encouraged me to travel the world and view things from alternative perspectives. After exciting trips, not only have I brought back with me unforgettable memories about places and people, but I also have the chance to expand my food palate and enrich my cookbook. I do enjoy cooking for myself and my loved ones every day and I truly believe you are what you eat.</p>
		<p>If you want to contact me for future collaborations, please email me at <a href="mailto:diamondngktc@gmail.com" style="color: #000;text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold">diamondngktc@gmail.com</a> </p>
